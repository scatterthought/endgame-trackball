## Assembly guide 🕐 1 to 3 hours

Okay, so you've got your package box. What now? First things first, let's see what you should have.

![preparation](./images/assembly/preparation.png)

### Included in every kit

> [!TIP]
> To get magnets and knobs out, the packaging box has holes on the opposite sides. The holes fit your hex key.

1) The PCB panel
2) FDM printed parts: shell, bottom part, 8 buttons, a fixture, and 3 adapters for static bearings.
3) SLA printed parts: two knobs and one guide for assembly.
4) Battery — although, for the sake of shipping safety, it will most likely be already installed in its place.
5) Flat printed cables — three long and one short.
6) Two sets of PMW3610 sensor and its lens.
   
...and the rest of small things: a vibration motor, two ball bearings, three static bearings, magnets, heat-set inserts, M2 screws, rubber feet, a hex key and a tube of glue. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you are among first 100 customers, you will also have two separate breakout boards for the sensors.  
> **Those in the panel cannot be used in such a case. Please throw them to the trash.** 

### Required from your side
1) A soldering iron, flux and solder.
2) IPA for cleaning.
3) Some tweezers, not exactly required but makes things easier.
4) A marker.

You also need some flat hard surface to work on. Bonus points if it's ferromagnetic! A 3D printing bed is a nice option.
Now, I also have an electric screwdriver here, and I hope you will forgive me for using it not the hex key.

### Preparation

> [!TIP]
> Check your board — connect it to a power source (preferably wall adapter, PC is an option but it may [produce phantom reports](https://github.com/efogtech/endgame-trackball/issues/4)).  
> Expected behavior: red LED blinks twice and turns off, green LED starts blinking slowly, the device is discoverable via BLE.

The very first thing to do is to depanelize the PCB. Hold it firmly and push at the center, between boards.
It would be really hard to break it in a wrong place so don't worry.

![depanelization](./images/assembly/depanelization.png)

Remove the excess tabs with pliers or whatever tool you have. Remove two edge rails.
Now, if you have ordered solderless option, you can skip to [gluing](#gluing).

### First steps
Now that you are prepared, let's heat up the soldering iron.
Take the top part — we will install heat-set inserts to the shell first.
Grab 5 inserts and place them into the appropriate holes.
One of the sides will be narrower, that's the side that goes inside.
They should stay in place without you holding them.

Now, if your iron lets you control the temperature, set it to 240°C or 460°F.
If not, well, that's unfortunate, but it still works.
You need to push the insert gently, while keeping it on its "trajectory".
So, try to apply force just in one direction, vertical, in this case. It's like playing a violin. 
I'm sure every one of you knows how to play violin so it's great to have such a nice comparison.
Okay, push them until they sit flush. The whole process should take just several seconds.

![inserts-btm](./images/assembly/inserts-btm.png)

Now, do the same with 4 inserts for the bottom part (the picture shows two, hope you will excuse me). 

![sensor1](./images/assembly/sensor1.png)

### Sensors
Cool, now that we're done with the inserts, let's move forward to the sensors.
Take one sensor, and visually locate the "PMW3610" text.
Take a breakout board, and insert the sensor so that the FPC connector is on the bottom and the PMW3610 text is on the top.

![sensor-orientation](./images/assembly/sensor-orientation.jpg)

Now, turn it over, keeping the IC from falling out, and solder it down.
Do the same with the second sensor. Clean the boards and let's move on to the next step.

### Rest of the soldering
Take the motherboard — we're going to solder your microswitches and install the vibration motor.
Now, please be extremely careful while soldering microswitches. Almost every pad has a bunch of micro passives near it.
It's really easy to desolder one or several, ask me how I know. Admittedly, a big oversight from my side.
Desoldering may or may not be fatal — if it's a capacitor, you lose just hardware debounce functionality.
If it's a resistor, the button is dead, and you need to either solder a new resistor or short the pads.  

Now, keeping that in mind, do the job. Silkscreen will guide you in terms of how to install switches.  
Here goes the vibration motor too — red is plus, blue is minus, and you have silkscreen hints over there.  
Let's clean up and move on. You can turn your soldering iron off now.

### Gluing

> [!TIP]
> B-7000 glue loves to leave glue strings everywhere. Fear not, they are easy to remove afterwards.

Take glue. You will need it for two things: magnets and lenses. Let's deal with the lenses first.
Take kapton tape off and put the lenses in their places.
You can determine the correct orientation with a neat trick USB teaches us — just try both.
Make sure it sits flush and pour just a little bit of glue on both sides.

![sens-glue](./images/assembly/sens-glue.jpg)

Now, please be careful, either do that in midair, or get something to put under the sensor — you see, there are plastic rods sticking out of the IC at the bottom, and if you place the board onto a flat surface, your lens will push itself off. After applying glue, let the sensor boards rest for 10-15 minutes. But put something beneath them anyway.

### Magnets
Take all your magnets and make a single rod (tower) out of them. Now, take your marker and mark one side of the tower.
Always (literally) keep this side on top, it will allow you to keep the polarity right.

Apply glue to all the buttons.
Note that you don't need to pour glue, you just want to leave a little ...glue mark?
By the way, the glue is not instantaneous and takes 10-20 minutes to harden.

Now, there are two options. Either take magnets one by one, keeping the polarity right, and place them into slots,
or just insert the whole tower into a slot and then move it sideways. Then, apply downward force to the magnet.

Okay, so you're done with the buttons, let's proceed with the shell now. Place it onto a flat hard surface.
The procedure is the same, you keep your polarity mark at the top, and install magnets one by one.
There is one important thing to keep in mind — if you're using the tower method, make sure to NEVER pull the tower up, only move it sideways.
Otherwise, you will bend the button and... well that's bad.

You're done with the magnets! You can take the glue away, you won't need it anymore.
Now, you need to make a 10-15 minutes pause before continuing, to allow the glue to harden a little.

### Cables

> [!CAUTION]
> Inserting a sensor cable in a wrong way will be fatal for the sensor. Please ensure all your cables are installed identically, with the contact side on top.  
> Again — **any flat printed cable must be installed in the way displayed on the photo below**.

Install the cables into the daughter boards, **with the contact side facing you**:

![cable](./images/assembly/cable.jpg)

> [!TIP]
> The black thingy is a flip lock, flip it away from the cable for it to be in a horizontal position to lock the cable.  
> You should not leave the connectors unlocked. 

The short FPC goes into one of the sensors — it will go to the right side. Also, take your marker and mark the other ends of the sensor cables.  
Don't skip this step as future you may regret such a decision. The marking will help you to distinguish encoder and sensor cables. 

### Rotary encoders and knobs
Next step will require a sacrifice. Don't worry, none of your blood will be spilled, unless you're terrible with tweezers.
Take the bottom part and locate the sacrificial layer — loose plastic strings beneath the holes for the bearings.
Remove those with any method available. You don't need the thing to be perfectly clean, just don't leave loose plastic.

![loose1](./images/assembly/loose1.png)
![loose2](./images/assembly/loose2.png)

Now that you've done that, place one of the daughter boards under the bearing hole you just cleared (they just slide in), 
line up the screw holes, and screw them down, but not fully. Just a few rotations will be enough for now. 

Proceed with the second one. Next, take the "guide" part. You should put it into the encoder, and then tighten the board.  
Be careful — when pulling it out, do not apply any force sideways! Pull straight upward.  

Now, take ball bearings, knobs and the "fixture" part. 
Install the bearings onto the knobs — should be possible without the fixture, 
but it's there for you, and then verify your positioning: install the knobs and try them.  
If you don't hear satisfying clicks, repeat the positioning procedure.  
Here's video of the full process:
[/video/assembly/knobs.mp4](./video/assembly/knobs.mp4)

Remove the knobs for now.

### Installing sensors
Keep in mind: the one with the short cable goes to the right side (rght in the case when the board is oriented for normal use, left on the photo below).
Put a sensor board on its place, screw it down while holding it gently from the top side (so it stays in its lowest position). 
Do that with the second one. That's it! Please refer to the photos to see orientation and preferred cable management.

> [!CAUTION]
> The photo shows bearings already installed. This is incorrect.  
> You SHOULD NOT install any bearings until the device is fully assembled.  

![cab-orient](./images/assembly/cab-orient.jpg)

### Motherboard
Next, push cable pairs into the appropriate slots in the motherboard.
You want the blue stiff part of the cable to face you while doing that.

![fpc](./images/assembly/fpc.jpg)

Connect the cables, and fix them in place. 
Cables for the sensors go straight, those for the rotary encoders go diagonally. 
Luckily, you have the sensor cables marked! Here's a photo with the correct wiring of the sensors:

![wiring](./images/assembly/wiring.png)

Make sure your knobs are installed.  
Now, place the motherboard onto the bottom part in the way that the cables do not interfere with the plastic features.  
Screw down the motherboard, and install the vibration motor — remove the peel and place the motor onto the vertical feature sticking out on the left side of the bottom part.
Make sure that the motor does not touch the "floor" (bottom surface); it should have at least 1 mm clearance. Almost done!  

### Testing

> [!NOTE]
> In this photo, a cable is trapped beneath the PCB where the fourth screw should go.  
> This is incorrect — ensure the PCB sits flush and no cables obstruct the screw hole.

Now is a great moment to test your assembly. Make sure it looks like this: 

![final-step](./images/assembly/final-step.jpg)

Connect the battery cable, and then connect the USB cable. You should see a new input device in your system.

> [!TIP]
> Please be aware that the motherboard will not get powered after connecting the battery.  
> It is required to connect USB power to "bootstrap" the power distribution chip.  

### Final steps
Anyway, let's install the shell! Visually line up the holes and the knobs, then slide the shell onto the bottom part.

![shell](./images/assembly/shell1.png)
![shell](./images/assembly/shell2.png)

Turn it over, and screw it down: start with one of the bottom screws, continue with the opposite top screw and so on.
Install the rubber feet with the help of the visual guiding features.

### Static bearings
Now, the last step — take your adapters for static bearings.
Here's what to do: place a bearing onto the side hole and push it inside with the hex key.
You cannot scratch the bearing because it's harder than the key.
Now that it's inside, take a screw and tighten it from the bottom, while keeping the side hole upward to keep the ball from moving sideways. 
Install your bearings of choice and keycaps — you're good to go!

### Use the device!
[Here's the default keymap](https://github.com/efogtech/endgame-trackball?tab=readme-ov-file#default-keymap). 
You can install [ZMK Studio](https://zmk.studio/download) to reconfigure it, or just go ahead with using it as is.

> [!TIP]
> Please make sure your adapters or BTUs are inserted fully. It's a tight fit and might require some force.

It is highly recommended to either build a fresh firmware, or download one from the product page, to ensure having up-to-date bugfixes and updates.
